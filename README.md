# Lighthouses
This is a basic program that allows you to manage lighthouse information. You can use it to add new lighthouses and view existing ones. You can enter basic information such as the name, location, height, year first lit, light range, and even the light characteristics of each lighthouse. You can also add and edit reviews/comments to each lighthouse, to keep track of your personal experiences and opinions. It's a great program to keep track of lighthouses you've visited and details you remember or like about them.
