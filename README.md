# Lighthouse
This is a basic program that allows you to manage lighthouse information. You can use it to add new lighthouses, view existing ones, update details, or delete lighthouses. You can enter basic information such as the name, location, height, year first lit, light range, and even the light characteristics of each lighthouse. You can also add reviews and comments to each lighthouse, to keep track of your personal experiences and opinions. It's a great program to keep track of lighthouses you've visited and details you remember or like about them. So, which is your favorite lighthouse?




Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Express.js, MongoDB and OAuth

Next Steps: I'd like for users to be able to upload photos and make rewards or badges for those who visited alot of lighthouses and add their experience and details.
